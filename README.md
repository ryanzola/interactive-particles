# 3D Lissajous Curve Particles Motion Study

Dynamic particles moving along Lissajous curves in 3D space, further animated with sinusoidal computations to simulate a circular pattern around the primary curve.

## Overview

Particles in this system are:

- Placed along a Lissajous curve in 3D.
- Animated to move in circles around the curve using their normal and binormal vectors.
- Dynamically affected by both predefined particle attributes and global parameters.

The outcome is a mesmerizing visual display of particles swirling in a complex 3D pattern, changing and evolving over time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Lissajous Curve Generation**: Particles follow a form of Lissajous curve, with their position in space being determined by the progress along the curve.

- **Circular Pattern Movement**: By leveraging tangent, normal, and binormal vectors, each particle dances around the primary curve in a circular pattern.

- **Time-Dependent Animation**: The system utilizes a global time variable that ensures the continuous and smooth animation of particles.

- **Attribute-Based Variability**: Each particle can have its individual characteristics (e.g., size, random values) that affect its motion, making the overall motion diverse and less uniform.
